3 types of variables is
local
instance
static
LOcal-are the variables which are created inside a block of code
 like method, loop, switch statement, if else condition
 or constructor
 Adventages:
-We should always prefer  local variables to instance or
static variables
-live for the shortest period of time inside your RAM
Disadventages:
They can't be accssed outside of the block of code
 in which they are created
 Class Countries{
 void USA (){
 String person"Elisa Bro";
 }
 void Ukraine(){
 System.out.println(person)// we will get an error because right
 now Person is only accessible in USA method
 }
 }
 Instance variables:
 they are created inside the class but outside a block of code.
Adventages:
-instance variables are accessible everywhere in a class
in all the block of code inside that class, but not in a static
method
Disadvantages:
-they keep on occupying the memory for longer period of time.
Static variables:
if we have a instance variables with a static keyword then it is called
as static variables
Advantages:
the have highest scope aviables even outside of an object
and are class level variables that's why it does not matter how many
objects we create from that class only one variables is created

Disadvantages:
they occupy the memory for longest period of time
they can hold only the single value for all the objects
